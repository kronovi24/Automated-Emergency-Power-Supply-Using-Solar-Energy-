# IOT-based-Monitoring-and-Controller-Mobile-App-of-Emergency-Power-Supply

Abstract— This study is developed to create an Automated Power Supply using Solar Energy with IOT-based monitoring and controller mobile application that mainly uses a raspberry pi as the main processor of the system to act as an alternative power supply to a facility. The researchers used a 12v 120 watts’ solar panel to gather solar energy, multiple series and paralleled lithium-ion batteries to store energy, a 20amps PWM Solar Charge Controller to charge and manage the battery system and IOT-based components to control and automate the system with dedicated mobile application. The researchers conducted an observation and research on a specific target which is the Brgy. Serna’s Barangay Hall where the system will be implemented. The researchers were able to fabricate and developed an automated emergency power supply that can provide up to 60,000mAH of energy that can be controlled and monitored via mobile application. After multiple testing conducted by the researchers, the fabrication and development of the system were found and proved to work functionally with a good maintainability as hardware parts are available locally. However, the developed system has limitation, It’s recommended that the future researchers should add features like SMS notifications, upgrade the capacity of the batteries and etc.
